## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

Due to the addition of repositories in the [previous version](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.60), it is evident that User::Registration and User::AccountDeletion have methods in their repositories that use an Account::Record. In other words, it is clear that User::Record is tightly coupled to Account::Record and should not be.

To solve this, a new [account_members table](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.80/db/schema.rb#L14-L19) (and model  Account::Member::Record) is created with just one column (uuid), and a column [uuid is also added to the user's table](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.80/db/schema.rb#L73).

While we won't be using a foreign key, the plan is to start referencing the users' UUID in the account members table. This approach will allow us to transfer several associations from the [User::Record](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.80/app/models/user/record.rb) model to [Account::Member::Record](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.80/app/models/account/member/record.rb), effectively decoupling the User and Account contexts. This will significantly enhance the system's orthogonality, minimizing the risk of changes in one context affecting the other.
