## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

Since [version 2.40 introduces the Repository pattern](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.40/app/models/account/member/repository.rb), what would happen if all processes/contexts started using this pattern?

This version answers this question in practice by introducing a repository for each context and forcing the application to start using them instead of directly using the ActiveRecord models.
