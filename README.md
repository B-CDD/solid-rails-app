## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

This version transforms the User and Account modules into facades. Processes and repositories are now exposed through simple methods. Another benefit is that shared and repeated behavior (such as instantiating entities) can be done through the facade, eliminating duplication and abstracting this complexity from the entry points.
