## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

From version 2 onwards, all contexts (Account and User) implement their operations through processes. Because of this, it becomes possible to create a composition of processes where they are defined as dependencies that will be orchestrated through their steps.

Notes:

1. [UserToken](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.00/app/models/user_token.rb) becomes hugely lean because the model's behavior has been diluted into different components within the [User::Token namespace](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/tree/solid-process-2.00/app/models/user/token). I am highlighting [User::Token::Entity](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.00/app/models/user/token/entity.rb), a PORO capable of representing a token without the need to interact with the database (ActiveRecord model).

2. New features are added to input blocks, such as data normalization and validation.
