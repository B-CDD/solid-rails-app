## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

This version makes usage of another `Solid::Adapters` feature, the [interface mechanism](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-adapters?tab=readme-ov-file#solidadaptersinterface) to strengthen the contracts between the core and the application. Because of this, the core can [establish](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-4/lib/core/user/adapters/repository_interface.rb) and [demand](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-4/lib/core/user/registration.rb#L13) its contracts (ports).

Note: In case of a breach of contract, the system will raise an exception indicating what was compromised and needs to be fixed.
