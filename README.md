## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

Defines types for input attributes and uses steps to perform all operations within a transaction block that will perform a rollback if any step returns a failure. After the commit, the confirmation email is sent, and the created user is exposed in the [User::Registration](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-1/app/models/user/registration.rb) result.

Note: In this version, the process input ([User::Registration::Input](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-1/app/controllers/web/guest/registrations_controller.rb#L6)) is used in the view forms, causing the view to be coupled to it and no longer to the User model (ActiveRecord).
