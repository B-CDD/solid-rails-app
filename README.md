## ðŸ’¡ Branch summary

If we analyze the previous version, we will see that the [ActiveRecord models are not defined within the context of the user or account](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/tree/solid-process-2.00/app/models).

What this version does is rename the ActiveRecord models as [Record](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/blob/solid-process-2.20/app/models/user/record.rb) (for this, it is necessary to define the table_name and class_name in the classes) within the [Account](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/tree/solid-process-2.20/app/models/account) and [User](https://github.com/solid-process/solid-rails-app/tree/solid-process-2.20/app/models/user) namespaces (they become mere modules since before both were also an ActiveRecord model)
